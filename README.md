# 11TA - 11ty, TailwindCSS, & Alpine.js Template

> **UPDATE v2.0.0 - Breaking Changes**
> In order to provide scalability and cleaner frontmatter controls in current Posts _(and upcoming Products)_ collections, the Frontmatter keys were updated which required updates to `/src/_includes/components/*.njk`, `tailwind.config.js`, and other templates.
> I apologize for the inconvenience.

I set out to build a starter project template for 11ty that has TailwindCSS and Alpine.js baked in.

Version 1.0.0 morphed into a deeply customizable, full featured, text-based CMS for managing small websites with easy-to-manage configuration files in the `/src/_data/` directory.

## :fire: Credit :fire:

First and foremost, I want to credit the [11ty](https://11ty.dev) community, especially those listed in the [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/)!

Specifically, the following starter projects helped me understand the power and flexibility of 11ty and from their examples I was able to extend the functionality to build this system:
