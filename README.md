# 11TA - 11ty, TailwindCSS, & Alpine.js Template

I set out to build a starter project template for 11ty that has TailwindCSS and Alpine.js baked in.

Version 1.0.0 morphed into a fully-configurable text-based CMS for managing small websites with easy-to-manage configuration files in the `/src/_data/` directory.

## Live Demo

**The live demo at https://11ta.netlify.app provides a feature list, and the evolving blog posts each highlight and provide examples of different features, shortcodes, customizations, and frontmatter controls.** 

## :fire: Credit :fire:

First and foremost, I want to credit the [11ty](https://11ty.dev) community, especially those listed in the [starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/)!

Specifically, the following starter projects helped me understand the power and flexibility of 11ty and from their examples I was able to extend the functionality to build this system:
